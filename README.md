## Description

HexHive showcases a swarm of hexagon-shaped particles that explode outward from the center of the screen, mimicking the frenzied flight of bees. With vibrant yellow and orange tones, the animation evokes both the essence of a beehive and a fiery burst of energy. Perfect for web enthusiasts and animation lovers, this project is lightweight, responsive, and easy to explore.

## Installation

### To get started with HexHive locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HexHive.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```
cd HexHive
```

3. Open index.html in your web browser—no additional setup or dependencies needed!

### Usage
Once you open index.html, the animation kicks off automatically. Here’s what you can do:

- Watch the hexagonal particles swarm and spark across the screen.
- Resize your browser window to see how the animation adjusts dynamically to different dimensions.

### Customization
Want to tweak the animation? Open script.js and play with the following settings:

**count: Adjust the number of particles (e.g., increase to 30 for a denser swarm).
**particleSize: Change the size of the hexagons.
**color: Modify the particle color (defaults to bee-like yellow).
**sparkChance: Control the frequency of fiery orange sparks.
***len: Set how far particles travel per frame.

For example, to make the particles larger:

javascript
```
particleSize: 10,
```
